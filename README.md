## Breaking Changes

- Any plugins or includes that rely on the .ff2 file extension will no longer function correctly. (Such as Epic Scout's AMS)
- Abilities are no longer activated in a set order.
- Bosses can not have the multiple abilities with the same name.
- FF2_GetSpecialKV no longer can modify boss stats.
- Less restrictions on when natives or forwards can be used. (Such as FF2_StartMusic)
